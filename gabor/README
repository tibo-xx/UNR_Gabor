TODO:
- Fix bug with NCSTools communication.
- Implement commands received from NCSTools (pause, heartbeat, etc.)
  --> Parse command and take action in beginning of main loop

Main DisplayFunc "Loop":

	recv from NCSTools server: parse command and take action
	
	return if paused / throttle flag not set
	
	capture from camera
	
	get subimage/pad
	
	offload subimage to gpu
	
	perform gabor filtering and get probabilities for reach filter
	
	if !differenceFlag return (should work for NOT diffed option too - 
		we will just receive 2 images before probability calculation
		and sending)
	
	create all textures and render
	
	publish probabilities to NCS
	
	write probs to file (if configured to do so)
	
	update FPS title
